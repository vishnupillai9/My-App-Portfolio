# My App Portfolio
This is the first app I made as a part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegrees-new-s/nd801) program. The app showcases the portfolio of apps which I will be building in the Nanodegree. 

Following are the projects I've completed so far: 
- [Popular Movies](https://github.com/vishnupillai9/Popular-Movies) (Stage 1) - Android app that helps users discover popular and recent movies.
